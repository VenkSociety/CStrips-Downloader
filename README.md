# How to run:
1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) _(Standalone CLI app is planned)_.
2. Replace `_USER` in [run.py](https://github.com/VenkSociety/CStrips-Downloader/blob/master/run.py#L16) with yours or your friend's Bitstrips user ID. For example https://bitstrips.com/user/D53J, the ID would be D53J.
3. Open your command prompt or terminal _(Type `cmd` into your  Windows search bar)_.
4. `cd` to the folder where you downloaded the script. E.g, `cd C:\Users\Buddy\Desktop\CStrips Downloader`.
5. From your terminal type the following command: `python run.py`.

The script should now be running and starting to scan through and download your comics. 

**KEEP IN MIND:**

There are `60466176` possible combinations to scan for so it **will take a very long time** to download your comics. I did the math for my router and it estimated at around `29.16` days to download all comics. Feel free to look for ways to make the script faster. If you have any issues regarding installing or running, please make an issue [here](https://github.com/VenkSociety/CStrips-Downloader/issues) that shows the error or problem you're having.

Enjoy your comics!
